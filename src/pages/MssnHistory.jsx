          </h2>

            The <strong>Muslim Students' Society of Nigeria (MSSN)</strong> is
            the oldest and largest Islamic student organization in Nigeria,
            founded to promote Islamic education, unity, and welfare among
            Muslim students.

            Foundation and Early Years (1954 - 1960s)
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            MSSN was established on April 18, 1954, at{" "}
            <strong>King’s College, Lagos</strong>, by a group of young Muslim
            students. The founder and first National President was{" "}
            <strong>Dr. AbdulLateef Adegbite</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            The organization was created to address the lack of Islamic support
            for students in Christian-dominated schools. In the 1950s, many
            Muslim students faced discrimination, lack of prayer spaces, and no
            access to Islamic education in schools. MSSN emerged to protect
            Muslim students' rights and promote Islamic values in schools and
            universities.

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            MSSN expanded beyond Lagos into different states and universities.
            By the 1970s, it had strong chapters in universities and secondary
            schools across Nigeria.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
            The Nigerian government officially recognized MSSN as a national
            student organization. It became an influential group in the Nigerian
            Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), advocating for Muslim
            students’ rights and education policies.
